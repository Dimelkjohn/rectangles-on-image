# rectangles-on-image

Executable code: MyPicasso.exe 
***(Please, download it despite the warning)***

**App Functionalities:**
1) User can select and upload an image
2) User can draw multiple rectangles by clicking and dragging (only allowed inside picture)
4) User can change the rectangles color by right clicking rectangle, selecting "color", then choosing a recolor from a list of 3 colors.
5) User can delete any rectangle by right clicking any rectangle and selecting "delete".
6) User can save the edited image with the rectangles as a new image

**Future implementations:**  
(Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could complete these)
1) User should be able to resize any rectangle from any corner or side
2) User should be able to move a rectangle

**Resources:**
1) Stack Overflow
2) Udemy
3) Youtube

**Note:** I describe myself as a full stack developer but evidently, I'm a very visual orientated individual. So it will definately be great if I was considered for the frontend engineer position as well (I remember there being an opening).
